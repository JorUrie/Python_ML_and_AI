'''Convolutional Neural Networks are one of the popular Deep Artificial Neural Networks
CNNs are made up of neurons consisting of weights and biases
These neurons accept input data, process it, and then output something
The goal of the network is to go from the raw image data in the input layer to the correct class in the output layer
---- Types of layers in a CNN ----
Pooling: It's responsible for reducing the spatial size of the convoluted feature
Fully Connected Layer: Computes the output scores in the last layer
A perceptron is an artifitial neutron unit in a neural network'''
